I am a cryptocurrency and blockchain specialist with experience from [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/), startups, and corporations alike: my primary domains of expertise include governance, finance, operations, tooling, documentation, and programming. For more, see [*Background*]({{< ref "background.md" >}}).

Cryptocurrency will have a prodigious effect on economies and political systemsâ€”without proper diligence, this effect may tend towards dystopia. For this reason, I am a major advocate for sound governance and decentralization, as well as federated and peer-to-peer systems of communication.

I am also passionate about literature, history, anthropology, and art. I am a trumpet player, composer, and a producer, and primarily work on jazz, classical, ambient, and electronic music.
