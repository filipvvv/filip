**Welcome to filip.world.** I am a cryptocurrency and blockchain professional with experience from [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/), startups, and corporations alike: my primary domains of expertise are governance systems, decentralized (and traditional) finance, operations and logistics, documentation, and software/web development. For more, see my [Resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}).

Cryptocurrency will, as technology often does, have a prodigious effect on economies and political systems—without proper diligence, this may tend towards the dystopian. For this reason, I have immense passion for true decentralization, as well as federated and peer-to-peer systems of communication and governance.

I also have great passion for literature, history, anthropology, and art. I am a trumpet player, composer, and a producer of jazz, classical, ambient, and electronic music.
